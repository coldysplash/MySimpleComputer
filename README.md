## Usage

Clone the repository and Navigate to the project directory:

      git clone <repository-url>

      cd mysimplecomputer

Compile the source code:

      make

Run the program:

      make run

## Simple Assembler Translator (SAT)
The Simple Assembler translator converts programs written in Simple Assembler language into a binary format that can be executed by the Simple Computer model. 
- The example SimpleAssembler code is stored in the file code.sa and is automatically translated into the binary file SAT.o after you run the program. 
- To load a binary file into simplecomputer while the program is running, you need to press the "l" key, then enter the name of the executable file, after which the program will load and you can run it.
